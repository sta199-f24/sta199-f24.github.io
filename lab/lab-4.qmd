# Introduction

In this lab, you'll review topics you've worked with in previous labs, practice importing data, and dive into the concepts of data types and classes.

::: callout-note
This lab assumes you've completed the labs so far and doesn't repeat setup and overview content from those labs.
If you haven't done those yet, you should review the previous labs before starting on this one.
:::

## Learning objectives

By the end of the lab, you will...

-   Learn to read data in from Excel spreadsheets
-   Gain more experience with joining and pivoting data frames
-   Review Quarto cell options

And, as usual, you will also...

-   Get more experience with data science workflow using R, RStudio, Git, and GitHub
-   Further your reproducible authoring skills with Quarto
-   Improve your familiarity with version control using Git and GitHub

## Getting started

Log in to RStudio, clone your `lab-4` repo from GitHub, open your `lab-4.qmd` document, and get started!

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Click here if you prefer to see step-by-step instructions

### Step 1: Log in to RStudio

-   Go to <https://cmgr.oit.duke.edu/containers> and log in with your Duke NetID and Password.
-   Click `STA198-199` under My reservations to log into your container. You should now see the RStudio environment.

### Step 2: Clone the repo & start a new RStudio project

-   Go to the course organization at [github.com/sta199-f24](https://github.com/sta199-f24) organization on GitHub.
    Click on the repo with the prefix **lab-4**.
    It contains the starter documents you need to complete the lab.

-   Click on the green **CODE** button and select **Use SSH**.
    This might already be selected by default; if it is, you'll see the text **Clone with SSH**.
    Click on the clipboard icon to copy the repo URL.

-   In RStudio, go to *File* ➛ *New Project* ➛*Version Control* ➛ *Git*.

-   Copy and paste the URL of your assignment repo into the dialog box *Repository URL*. Again, please make sure to have *SSH* highlighted under *Clone* when you copy the address.

-   Click *Create Project*, and the files from your GitHub repo will be displayed in the *Files* pane in RStudio.

-   Click *lab-4.qmd* to open the template Quarto file.
    This is where you will write up your code and narrative for the lab.

### Step 3: Update the YAML

In `lab-4.qmd`, update the `author` field to your name, render your document and examine the changes.
Then, in the Git pane, click on **Diff** to view your changes, add a commit message (e.g., "Added author name"), and click **Commit**.
Then, push the changes to your GitHub repository, and in your browser confirm that these changes have indeed propagated to your repository.

## Packages

In this lab, we will work with the

-   **tidyverse** package for doing data analysis in a "tidy" way,
-   **readxl** package for reading in Excel files,
-   **janitor** package for cleaning up variable names, and
-   **palmerpenguins** and **datasauRus** packages for some datasets

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(janitor)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(datasauRus)
```

-   **Run** the code cell by clicking on the green triangle (play) button for the code cell labeled `load-packages`. This loads the package so that its features (the functions and datasets in it) are accessible from your *Console*.
-   Then, **render** the document that loads this package to make its features (the functions and datasets in it) available for other code cells in your Quarto document.

## Guidelines

{{< include _guidelines.qmd >}}

::: callout-important
Starting with this lab, you are expected to pay attention to [code smell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell) in addition to code style and readability.
You should review and improve your code to avoid redundant steps (e.g., grouping, ungrouping, and grouping again by the same variable in a pipeline), using inconsistent syntax (e.g., `!` to say "not" in one place and `-` in another place), etc.
:::

# Questions

## Part 1 - Team USA at the Olympics

For this part, you'll work with data from the rosters of Team USA from the 2020 and 2024 Olympics.
The data come from <https://www.teamusa.com> and the rosters for the two games are in a single Excel file (`team-usa.xlsx` in your `data` folder), accross two separate spreadsheets within that file.
@fig-olympics-sheets shows screenshots of these spreadsheets.

::: {#fig-olympics-sheets layout-ncol="2"}
![Team USA 2020](images/lab-4/team-usa-2020.png)

![Team USA 2024](images/lab-4/team-usa-2024.png)

Excel file with two sheets for rosters of Team USA 2020 and 2024.
:::

Your goal is to answer questions about athletes who competed in both games and only one of the games.

### Question 1

a.  Read data from the two sheets of `team-usa.xlsx` as two separate data frames called `team_usa_2020` and `team_usa_2024`.

::: callout-tip
The names of the sheets are shown in the screenshots in @fig-olympics-sheets, or you can use the `excel_sheets()` function to discover them.
Additionally, note that the first row of the sheets contain a logo and a title describing the contents of the data, and not the header row containing variable names.
:::

b.  Read the documentation for the `clean_names()` function from the **janitor** package at <https://sfirke.github.io/janitor/reference/clean_names.html>.
    Use this function to "clean" the variable names of `team_usa_2020` and `team_usa_2024` and save the data frames with the new variable names.

c.  Create a new variable in both of the datasets called `name` that:

    -   `paste()`s together the `first_name` and `last_name` variables with a space in between and
    -   is the first variable in the resulting data frame.

d.  Using the appropriate `*_join()` function, determine how many athletes participated in both Olympic Games?

::: callout-important
Your answer to this question, based on the data frames you created, should be 0, even if it doesn't make sense in context of actual Olympic athletes.
:::

### Question 2

If you have even a passing knowledge of the Olympic Games, you might know that there are some athletes that participated in both the 2020 and 2024 games, e.g., Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, etc.

a. The reason why athlete names didn't match across the two data frames is that in one data frame, names are in UPPER CASE, and in the other, they're in Title Case. Update the 2020 data frame to make `name` all upper case. Display the first 10 rows of `team_usa_2020` with upper case names.

::: callout-important
Your answer must use the `str_to_upper()` function.
:::

b.  Let's try that question again: How many athletes participated in both Olympic Games?

c.  How many athletes participated in the 2020 Olympic Games but not the 2024 Olympic Games?
    How many athletes participated in the 2024 Olympic Games but not the 2020 Olympic Games?

## Part 2 - DatasauRus

The data frame you will be working with in this part is called `datasaurus_dozen` and it's in the **datasauRus** package.
This single data frame contains 13 datasets, designed to show us why data visualization is important and how summary statistics alone can be misleading.
The different datasets are marked by the `dataset` variable, as shown in @fig-datasaurus.

![The \`datasaurus_dozen\` data frame stacks 13 datasets on top of each other. This figure shows the first three datasets.](images/lab-4/datasaurus-dozen.png){#fig-datasaurus fig-align="center" width="432"}

::: callout-note
If it's confusing that the data frame is called `datasaurus_dozen` when it contains 13 datasets, you're not alone!
Have you heard of a [baker's dozen](https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/32259/why-bakers-dozen-13)?
:::

Here is a peek at the top 10 rows of the dataset:

```{r}
#| eval: true
datasaurus_dozen
```

### Question 3

In a single pipeline, calculate the mean of `x`, mean of `y`, standard deviation of `x`, standard deviation of `y`, and the correlation between `x` and `y` for each level of the `dataset` variable.
Then, in 1-2 sentences, comment on how these summary statistics compare across groups (datasets).

::: callout-tip
There are 13 groups but `tibble`s only print out 10 rows by default.
To display all rows, add `print(n = 13)` as the last step of your pipeline.
:::

### Question 4

Create a scatterplot of `y` versus `x` and color and facet it by `dataset`.
Then, in 1-2 sentences, how these plots compare across groups (datasets).
How does your response in this question compare to your response to the previous question and what does this say about using visualizations and summary statistics when getting to know a dataset?

::: callout-tip
When you both color and facet by the same variable, you'll end up with a redundant legend.
Turn off the legend by adding `show.legend = FALSE` to the geom creating the legend.
:::

::: render-commit-push
Render, commit, and push your changes.
Make sure that you commit and push all changed documents and that your Git pane is completely empty before proceeding.

## Part 3 - Medical marijuana in NC

SurveyUSA polled 900 NC adults between September 4-7, 2024.
Of the 900 NC adults, 771 were identified by SurveyUSA as being registered to vote.[^1]
The following question was asked to these 771 adults:

[^1]: Full survey results can be found at <https://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=c6995e17-3837-413e-ac98-3684e1c74dc1>.

> Should the use of marijuana for medical use remain against the law in North Carolina?
> Or be legalized?

Responses were broken down into the following categories:

| Variable | Levels                                          |
|:---------|:------------------------------------------------|
| Age      | 18-49; 50+                                      |
| Opinion  | Remain Against The Law; Be Made Legal; Not Sure |

Of the 771 responses, 391 were between the ages of 18-49.
Of the individuals that are between 18-49, 59 individuals responded that they think medical marijuana should remain against the law, 292 said it should be made legal, and the remainder were not sure.
Of the individuals that are 50+, 67 individuals responded that they think medical marijuana should remain against the law, 245 said it should be made legal, and the remainder were not sure.

### Question 5

a.  Fill in the code below to create a two-way table that summarizes these data.

    ```{r}
    #| eval: false

    survey_counts <- tibble( 
      age = c(),
      opinion = c(),
      n = c()
      )

    survey_counts |>
      pivot_wider( 
        names_from = ___,
        values_from = ___
      )
    ```

For parts b-d below, use a single pipeline starting with `survey_counts`, calculate the desired proportions, and make sure the result is an **ungrouped** data frame with a column for relevant counts, a column for relevant proportions, and a column for the groups you're interested in.

b.  Calculate the proportions of 18-49 year olds and 50+ year-olds in this sample.

c.  Calculate the proportions of those who think medical marijuana should remain against the law, should be made legal, and who are not sure.

d.  Calculate the proportions of individuals in this sample who think medical marijuana should remain against the law, should be made legal, and who are not sure

    -   among those who are 18-49 years old and
    -   among those who are 50+ years old.

### Question 6

a.  Create a visualization that can be used to evaluate the relationship between `age` and `opinion` on legalizing medical marijuana in North Carolina based on this survey's results.

    ::: callout-tip
    Your visualization should display the proportions you calculated in Question 5d.
    :::

b.  Based on your calculations so far, as well as your visualization, write 1-2 sentences that describe the relationship, in this sample, between age and opinion on legalizing medical marijuana in North Carolina.

::: render-commit-push
Render, commit, and push one last time.
Make sure that you commit and push all changed documents and that your Git pane is completely empty before proceeding.
:::

## Part 4 - `mtcars`

In this part, you'll work with one of the most basic and overused datasets in R: `mtcars`.
The data in this dataset come from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine (so, yes, they're old!) and provide information on fuel efficiency and other car characteristics.

### Question 7

Since the dataset is used in many code examples, it's not unexpected that some analyses of the data are good and some not so much.

::: callout-tip
For both parts of this question, you should review the data dictionary that is in the documentation for the dataset which you can find at <https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/mtcars.html> or by typing `?mtcars` in your Console.
:::

a\.
You come across the following visualization of these data.
First, determine what is wrong with this visualization and describe it in one sentence.
Then, fix and improve the visualization.
As part of your improvement, make sure your legend

-   is on top of the plot,
-   is informative, and
-   lists levels in the order they appear in the plot.

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, color = am)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    x = "Weight (1000 lbs)",
    y = "Miles / gallon"
  )
```

b\.
Update your plot from part (a) further, this time using different shaped points for cars with V-shaped and straight engines.
Once again, some requirements for your legend – it should be informative and on the right of the plot.

### Question 8

Your task is to make your plot from Question 7b as ugly and as ineffective as possible.
Change colors, axes, fonts, themes, or anything else you can think of in the code chunk below.
You can also search online for other themes, fonts, etc. that you want to tweak.
Try to make it as ugly as possible, the sky is the limit!
You must make at least 5 updates to the plot.

Your answer must include

-   a list of the at least 5 updates you've made to your plot from Question 7b, and

-   1-2 sentence explanation of why the plot you created is *ugly* (to you, at least) and ineffective.

::: render-commit-push
Render, commit, and push your work so far.
Make sure that you commit and push all changed documents and that your Git pane is completely empty before proceeding.

## Part 5 - All about Quarto

### Question 9

You have the following code chunk:

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)) + 
  geom_point()
```

Add the following code cell options, one at a time, and set each to `false` and then to `true`.
After each value, render your document and observe its effect.
Ultimately, choose the values that are the most appropriate for this code cell.
Based on the behaviors you observe, describe what each code cell option does.

-   `echo`

-   `warning`

-   `eval`

### Question 10

a.  You have the following code cell again.

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)) + 
  geom_point()
```

Add `fig-width` and `fig-asp` as code chunk options.
Try setting `fig-width` to values between 1 and 10.
Try setting `fig-asp` to values between 0.1 and 1.
Re-render the document after each value and observe its effect.
Ultimately, choose values that make the plot look visually pleasing in the rendered document.
Based on the behavior you observe, describe what each chunk option does.

::: callout-tip
Now that you've had more practice with figure sizing in Quarto documents, review all of the plots you made in this lab and adjust their widths and aspect rations to improve how they look in your rendered document.
:::

b\.
You have the following code cell, but look carefully, it’s not exactly the same!

```{r}
gplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)) + 
  geom_point()
```

Add `error` as a code chunk option and set it to `false` and then set it to `true`.
After each value, render your document and observe its effect.
Ultimately, choose the value that allows you to render your document without altering the code.
Based on the behavior you observe, describe what this code chunk option does.

::: callout-tip
Reading [the documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/formats/pdf.html#execution) might also be helpful.
:::

::: render-commit-push
Render, commit, and push your work.
Make sure that you commit and push all changed documents and that your Git pane is completely empty before proceeding.
