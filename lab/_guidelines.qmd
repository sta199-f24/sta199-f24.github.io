As we've discussed in lecture, your plots should include an informative title, axes and legends should have human-readable labels, and careful consideration should be given to aesthetic choices.

Additionally, code should follow the [tidyverse style](https://style.tidyverse.org/).
Particularly,

-   there should be spaces before and line breaks after each `+` when building a `ggplot`,

-   there should also be spaces before and line breaks after each `|>` in a data transformation pipeline,

-   code should be properly indented,

-   there should be spaces around `=` signs and spaces after commas.

Furthermore, all code should be visible in the PDF output, i.e., should not run off the page on the PDF.
Long lines that run off the page should be split across multiple lines with line breaks.
