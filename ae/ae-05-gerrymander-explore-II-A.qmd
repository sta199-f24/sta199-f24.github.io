## Getting started

### Packages

We'll use the **tidyverse** package for this analysis.

```{r}
#| label: load-packages
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
library(usdata)
library(ggbeeswarm)
```

### Data

The data are availale in the **usdata** package.

```{r}
#| label: gerrymander
glimpse(gerrymander)
```

## Congressional districts per state

Which state has the most congressional districts?
How many congressional districts are there in this state?

```{r}
gerrymander |>
  count(state, sort = TRUE)
```

## Gerrymandering and flipping

Is a Congressional District more likely to be flipped to a Democratic seat if it has high prevalence of gerrymandering or low prevalence of gerrymandering?
Support your answer with a visualization and summary statistics.

```{r}
gerrymander |>
  mutate(flip18 = as.factor(flip18)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = gerry, fill = flip18)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill")

gerrymander |>
  count(gerry, dem18) |>
  group_by(gerry) |>
  mutate(p = n / sum(n))
```

## Aesthetic mappings

Recreate the following visualization, and then improve it.

![](images/gerrymander-recreate.png)

```{r}
#| label: gerrumander-recreate
ggplot(gerrymander, aes(x = gerry, y = clinton16)) +
  geom_beeswarm(color = "gray50", alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(color = gerry), alpha = 0.5) +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Render, commit, and push

1.  Render your Quarto document.

2.  Go to the Git pane and check the box next to each file listed, i.e., stage your changes.
    Commit your staged changes using a simple and informative message.

3.  Click on push (the green arrow) to push your changes to your application exercise repo on GitHub.
