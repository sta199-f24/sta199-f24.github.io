# Warm-up

## Announcements

-   Peer evaluation 1 due by 5:00 pm Friday (Oct 18) -- look for an email from TEAMMATES

-   My office hours this week: 4:30 - 6:30 pm on Friday at Old Chem 213, back to normal next week

-   Lab on Monday: Work on project proposals!

# Misrepresentation

## Misrepresenting data science results {.smaller}

Some common ways people do this, either intentionally or unintentionally, include:

::: incremental
-   Claiming **causality** where it's not in the scope of inference of the underlying study

-   Distorting **axes and scales** to make the data tell a different story

-   Visualizing **spatial areas instead of human density** for issues that depend on and affect humans

-   Omitting **uncertainty** in reporting

Moore, Steven C., et al. [**"Association of leisure-time physical activity with risk of 26 types of cancer in 1.44 million adults."**](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2521826) JAMA internal medicine 176.6 (2016): 816-825.

-   **Volunteers** were **asked** about their physical activity level over the preceding year.
-   Half exercised less than about 150 minutes per week, half exercised more.
-   Compared to the bottom 10% of exercisers, the top 10% had lower rates of esophageal, liver, lung, endometrial, colon, and breast cancer.
-   Researchers found no association between exercising and 13 other cancers (e.g. pancreatic, ovarian, and brain).

# Privacy

## "Your" data

Whether it's shared with others?

## Predicting ethnicity {.xxsmall}

[Improving Ecological Inference by Predicting Individual Ethnicity from Voter Registration Record](https://imai.fas.harvard.edu/research/race.html) (Imran and Khan, 2016)

> In both political behavior research and voting rights litigation, turnout and vote choice for different racial groups are often inferred using aggregate election results and racial composition.
> Over the past several decades, many statistical methods have been proposed to address this ecological inference problem.
> We propose an alternative method to reduce aggregation bias by predicting individual-level ethnicity from voter registration records.
> Building on the existing methodological literature, we use Bayes’s rule to combine the Census Bureau’s Surname List with various information from geocoded voter registration records.
> We evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology using approximately nine million voter registration records from Florida, where self-reported ethnicity is available.
> We find that it is possible to reduce the false positive rate among Black and Latino voters to 6% and 3%, respectively, while maintaining the true positive rate above 80%.
> Moreover, we use our predictions to estimate turnout by race and find that our estimates yields substantially less amounts of bias and root mean squared error than standard ecological inference estimates.
> We provide open-source software to implement the proposed methodology.
> The open-source software is available for implementing the proposed methodology.

- You might also be tempted to use your knowledge in a way that is ethically questionable either because of business goals or for the pursuit of further knowledge (or because your boss told you to do so)
