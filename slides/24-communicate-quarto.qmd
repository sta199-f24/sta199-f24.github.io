# Warm-up

## While you wait... {.smaller}

::: appex
-   Go to your `ae` project in RStudio.

-   Make sure all of your changes up to this point are committed and pushed, i.e., there's nothing left in your Git pane.

-   Click Pull to get today's application exercise file: *`{r} paste0(todays_ae, ".qmd")`*.

-   Wait till the you're prompted to work on the application exercise during class before editing the file.
:::

# From last time

## `ae-19-equality-randomization`

::: appex
-   Go to your ae project in RStudio.

-   Continue working on `ae-19-equality-randomization.qmd`.
:::

## Recap of AE {.smaller}

-   A hypothesis test is a statistical technique used to evaluate competing claims (null and alternative hypotheses) using data.
-   We simulate a null distribution using our original data.
-   We use our sample statistic and direction of the alternative hypothesis to calculate the p-value.
-   We use the p-value to determine conclusions about the alternative hypotheses.

# Projects with Quarto [live demo]

## Your project write-up with Quarto

- Figure sizing: `fig-width`, `fig-height`, etc. in code cells.

- Figure layout: `layout-ncol` for placing multiple figures in a chunk.

- Further control over figure layout with the **patchwork** package.

- Cell options for what makes it in your final report: `message`, `echo`, etc.

- Citations.

- Finalizing your report with `echo: false`.

## Building your project website with Quarto

- The `docs` folder.

- Making sure your website reflects your latest changes.

- Customizing the look of your website.

## Slides

- **Option 1:** Make your slides not in Quarto but make sure theyâ€™re available in your Quarto project website.

- **Option 2:** Make your slides with Quarto.

## Trends instructional staff employees in universities {.smaller}

The American Association of University Professors (AAUP) is a nonprofit membership association of faculty and other academic professionals.
[This report](https://www.aaup.org/sites/default/files/files/AAUP_Report_InstrStaff-75-11_apr2013.pdf) by the AAUP shows trends in instructional staff employees between 1975 and 2011, and contains the following image.
What trends are apparent in this visualization?

## Packages

## Data {.smaller}

Each row in this dataset represents a faculty type, and the columns are the years for which we have data.
The values are percentage of hires of that type of faculty for each year.

```{r}
#| label: load-data-staff

## Pay attention to variable types

::: task
What is wrong with the x-axis of the plot above? How can you fix it?
:::

. . .

Time is represented as a character string (equally spaces between levels) instead of on a continuous scale (with spacing indicating numbers of years between ticks.

## Fix variable types {.smaller}

```{r}
#| fig-asp: 0.5
#| fig-width: 12.0
#| code-fold: true
staff_long <- staff_long |>

ggplot(
  staff_long,
  aes(
    x = year,
    y = percentage,
    color = str_wrap(faculty_type, 20),
    group = str_wrap(faculty_type, 20)
  )

## Summary {.smaller}

-   Represent percentages as parts of a whole
-   Place variables representing time on the x-axis when possible
-   Pay attention to data types, e.g., represent time as time on a continuous scale, not years as levels of a categorical variable
-   Prefer direct labeling over legends
-   Use accessible colors
-   Use color to draw attention
-   Pick a purpose and label, color, annotate for that purpose
-   Communicate your main message directly in the plot labels
-   Simplify before you call it done (a.k.a. "Before you leave the house, look in the mirror and take one thing off")
