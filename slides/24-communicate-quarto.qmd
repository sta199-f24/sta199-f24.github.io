## Recap of AE {.smaller}

-   A hypothesis test is a statistical technique used to evaluate competing claims (null and alternative hypotheses) using data.
-   We simulate a null distribution using our original data.
-   We use our sample statistic and direction of the alternative hypothesis to calculate the p-value.
-   We use the p-value to determine conclusions about the alternative hypotheses.
