## Trends instructional staff employees in universities {.smaller}

The American Association of University Professors (AAUP) is a nonprofit membership association of faculty and other academic professionals.
[This report](https://www.aaup.org/sites/default/files/files/AAUP_Report_InstrStaff-75-11_apr2013.pdf) by the AAUP shows trends in instructional staff employees between 1975 and 2011, and contains the following image.
What trends are apparent in this visualization?

## Summary {.smaller}

-   Represent percentages as parts of a whole
-   Place variables representing time on the x-axis when possible
-   Pay attention to data types, e.g., represent time as time on a continuous scale, not years as levels of a categorical variable
-   Prefer direct labeling over legends
-   Use accessible colors
-   Use color to draw attention
-   Pick a purpose and label, color, annotate for that purpose
-   Communicate your main message directly in the plot labels
-   Simplify before you call it done (a.k.a. "Before you leave the house, look in the mirror and take one thing off")
