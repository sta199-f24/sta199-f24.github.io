# Warm-up

## While you wait... {.smaller}

::: appex
-   Go to your `ae` project in RStudio.

-   Make sure all of your changes up to this point are committed and pushed, i.e., there's nothing left in your Git pane.

-   Click Pull to get today's application exercise file: *`{r} paste0(todays_ae, ".qmd")`*.

-   Wait till the you're prompted to work on the application exercise during class before editing the file.

# From last time: Randomization

## Packages

```{r}
#| label: packages
#| echo: true
#| message: false
# load packages
library(tidyverse)   # for data wrangling and visualization
library(tidymodels)  # for modeling

## Data: Houses in Duke Forest {.smaller}

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Data on houses that were sold in the Duke Forest neighborhood of Durham, NC around November 2020
-   Scraped from Zillow
-   Source: [`openintro::duke_forest`](http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro/reference/duke_forest.html)

## Setting hypotheses

-   **Null hypothesis,** $H_0$: "There is nothing going on." The slope of the model for predicting the prices of houses in Duke Forest from their areas is 0, $\beta_1 = 0$.

-   **Alternative hypothesis,** $H_A$: "There is something going on".
    The slope of the model for predicting the prices of houses in Duke Forest from their areas is different than 0, $\beta_1 \ne 0$.

## Calculate observed slope

...
which we have already done:

```{r}
observed_fit <- duke_forest |>
  specify(price ~ area) |>
  fit()

observed_fit
```

## Simulate null distribution

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "|1|2|3|4|5|6"
set.seed(20241118)
null_dist <- duke_forest |>
  specify(price ~ area) |>
  hypothesize(null = "independence") |>
  generate(reps = 100, type = "permute") |>
  fit()
```

## View null distribution {.smaller}

```{r}
null_dist
```

## Visualize null distribution {.smaller}

```{r}
null_dist |>
  filter(term == "area") |>
  ggplot(aes(x = estimate)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 15)
```

## Visualize null distribution (alternative)

```{r}
visualize(null_dist) +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = observed_fit, direction = "two-sided")
```

## Get p-value {.smaller}

```{r}
null_dist |>
  get_p_value(obs_stat = observed_fit, direction = "two-sided")
```

## Make a decision

::: task
Based on the p-value calculated, what is the conclusion of the hypothesis test?
:::

# Inference for a mean

## Estimating the average price of houses in Duke Forest

::: task
Estimate the average price of houses in Duke Forest with a 95% confidence interval.
:::

## Computing the CI for the mean I

Calculate the observed **mean**:

```{r}
#| echo: true
observed_mean <- duke_forest |>
  specify(response = price) |>
  calculate(stat = "mean")

observed_mean
```

## Computing the CI for the mean II {.smaller}

Take `100` bootstrap samples and calculate the mean of each one:

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "|1|2|3|4|5"
set.seed(1121)

boot_means <- duke_forest |>
  specify(response = price) |>
  generate(reps = 100, type = "bootstrap") |>
  calculate(stat = "mean")

boot_means
```

## Computing the CI for the mean III

Compute the 95% CI as the middle 95% of the bootstrap distribution:

```{r}
get_confidence_interval(
  boot_means, 
  point_estimate = observed_mean, 
  level = 0.95,
  type = "percentile"
)
```

## Making a decision about the average price of houses in Duke Forest

::: task
An article in the Durham Herald Sun states that the average price of a house in Duke Forest is \$600,000.
Do these data provide convincing evidence to refute this claim?
:::

## Setting the hypotheses

Define $\mu$ as the true average price of all houses in Duke Forest:

::: incremental
-   $H_0: \mu = 600000$ - The true average price of all houses in Duke Forest is \$600,000 (as claimed by the Durham Herald Sun, i.e., there's nothing going on)

-   $H_A: \mu \ne 600000$ - The true average price of all houses in Duke Forest is different than \$600,000 (refuting the claim by the Durham Herald Sun, i.e., there is something going on)
:::

## Calculate the observed

Well, we already did this!

```{r}
observed_mean
```

## Simulate the null distribution {.smaller}

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "|5|6"
set.seed(1121)

null_means <- duke_forest |>
  specify(response = price) |>
  hypothesize(null = "point", mu = 600000) |>
  generate(reps = 100, type = "bootstrap") |>
  calculate(stat = "mean")

null_means
```

## Visualize the null distribution

```{r}
visualize(null_means)
```

## Calculate the p-value {.smaller}

- Probability of observed or lower outcome, given the given the null hypothesis is true: $P(\bar{x} < 559899 ~ | ~ \mu = 600000)$

. . .

- Probability of observed or more extreme outcome, given the null hypothesis is true:

$$
2 \times P(\bar{x} < 559899 ~ | ~ \mu = 600000)
$$

. . .

```{r}
null_means |>
  get_p_value(
    obs_stat = observed_mean, 
    direction = "two-sided"
  )
```

## Visualize the p-value {.smaller}

```{r}
visualize(null_means) +
  shade_p_value(
    obs_stat = observed_mean, 
    direction = "two-sided"
  )
```

# Application exercise

## `{r} todays_ae` {.smaller}

::: appex
-   Go to your ae project in RStudio.

-   If you haven't yet done so, make sure all of your changes up to this point are committed and pushed, i.e., there's nothing left in your Git pane.

-   If you haven't yet done so, click Pull to get today's application exercise file: *`{r} paste0(todays_ae, ".qmd")`*.

-   Work through the application exercise in class, and render, commit, and push your edits.

## Recap of AE {.smaller}

-   A hypothesis test is a statistical technique used to evaluate competing claims (null and alternative hypotheses) using data.
-   We simulate a null distribution using our original data.
-   We use our sample statistic and direction of the alternative hypothesis to calculate the p-value.
-   We use the p-value to determine conclusions about the alternative hypotheses.
