# Warm-up

## Announcements {.smaller}

-   AE 01 and AE 02 suggested answers posted on the course website.

-   Ed Discussion posts:

    -   Keep them coming!
    -   Keep them public!
    -   Feel free to make them anonymous if you prefer.

-   Monday's lab:

    -   Show up on time
    -   Show up to learn and get support
    -   Leave with all questions answered and a plan to work on the lab throughout the week

# From last time

## `ae-02-bechdel-dataviz`

::: appex
Go to RStudio, confirm that you're in the `ae` project, and open the document ae-02-bechdel-dataviz`.qmd`.
:::

## Recap: Code cells (aka code chunks) {.smaller}

![](images/03/code-cell.png) . . .

-   Cell `label`s are helpful for describing what the code is doing, for jumping between code cells in the editor, and for troubleshooting

-   `message: false` hides any messages emitted by the code in your rendered document

# Application exercise

## `ae-03-bechdel-data-viz-transform` {.smaller}

::: appex
-   Go to your ae project in RStudio.

-   Make sure all of your changes up to this point are committed and pushed, i.e., there's nothing left in your Git pane.

-   If you haven't yet done so, click Pull to get today's application exercise file: `ae-03-bechdel-data-viz-transform.qmd`.

-   Work through the application exercise in class, and render, commit, and push your edits by the end of class.

# Data transformation

## A quick reminder {.smaller}

```{r}
#| include: false
library(tidyverse)
bechdel <- read_csv("data/bechdel.csv")
```

```{r}
bechdel |> # <1>
  filter(roi > 400) |> # <2>
  select(title, roi, budget_2013, gross_2013, year, clean_test) # <3>
```

1.  Start with the `bechdel` data frame
2.  Filter for movies with `roi` greater than 400 (gross is more than 400 times budget)
3.  Select the columns `title`, `roi`, `budget_2013`, `gross_2013`, `year`, and `clean_test`

## The pipe `|>` {.smaller}

The pipe operator passes what comes before it into the function that comes after it as the first argument in that function.

::: columns
::: {.column .fragment width="55%"}
```{r}
sum(1, 2)
```
:::

::: {.column .fragment width="45%"}
```{r}
1 |> 
  sum(2)
```
:::
:::

<br>

::: columns
::: {.column .fragment width="55%"}
```{r}
select(filter(bechdel, roi > 400), title)
```
:::

::: {.column .fragment width="45%"}
```{r}
bechdel |>
  filter(roi > 400) |>
  select(title)
```

## Code style tip {{< fa lightbulb >}} {.smaller}

-   In data transformation pipelines, always use a
    -   space before `|>`
    -   line break after `|>`
    -   indent the next line of code

. . .

-   In data visualization layers, always use a
    -   space before `+`
    -   line break after `+`
    -   indent the next line of code

## The pipe, in action {.smaller}

::: task
Find movies that pass the Bechdel test and display their titles and ROIs in descending order of ROI.

. . .

Start with the `bechdel` data frame:

```{webr}
bechdel
```

## The pipe, in action {.smaller}

::: task
Find movies that pass the Bechdel test and display their titles and ROIs in descending order of ROI.
:::

Filter for rows where `binary` is equal to `"PASS"`:

```{webr}
bechdel |>
  filter(binary == "PASS")
```

## The pipe, in action {.smaller}

::: task
Find movies that pass the Bechdel test and display their titles and ROIs in descending order of ROI.
:::

Arrange the rows in `desc`ending order of `roi`:

```{webr}
bechdel |>
  filter(binary == "PASS") |>
  arrange(desc(roi))
```

## The pipe, in action {.smaller}

::: task
Find movies that pass the Bechdel test and display their titles and ROIs in descending order of ROI.
:::

Select columns `title` and `roi`:

```{webr}
bechdel |>
  filter(binary == "PASS") |>
  arrange(desc(roi)) |>
  select(title, roi)
```

## Time permitting {.smaller}

::: task
Ask another question of the data that can be answered with a data transformation pipeline.
