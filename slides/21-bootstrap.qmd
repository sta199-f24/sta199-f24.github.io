# Warm-up

## While you wait... {.smaller}

::: appex
-   Go to your `ae` project in RStudio.

-   Make sure all of your changes up to this point are committed and pushed, i.e., there's nothing left in your Git pane.

-   Click Pull to get today's application exercise file: *`{r} paste0(todays_ae, ".qmd")`*.

-   Wait till the you're prompted to work on the application exercise during class before editing the file.

## Announcements {.xxsmall}

Project timeline and progress:

::: incremental
-   **Due this Friday, Nov 15 - Milestone 3**
    -   Bare minimum: Address and close issues
    -   Ideal: Start working on your project write-up in `index.qmd`

-   **Before Monday, Nov 25 - Between Milestones 3 and 4**
    -   Bare minimum: Make substantial progress on your project write-up: Finish your introduction and exploratory data analysis (plots/summary statistics + their interpretations) + Write up methods you plan to use
    -   Ideal: Start implementing the methods and get closer to answering your research question

-   **On Monday, Nov 25 - Milestone 4**
    -   Peer review of others' projects in lab
    -   You must be in lab to participate in the peer review
    -   If you cannot be there physically due to Thanksgiving travel, make arrangements to Zoom in with the rest of your team who are in lab

-   **After Monday, Nov 26:** Work on write-up and presentation incorporating feedback from peers and meeting with TAs/instructor as needed during office hours for further feedback
:::

## From last time

::: appex
-   Go to your ae project in RStudio.

-   Continue working on `ae-17-forest-classification.qmd`.

# Quantifying uncertainty

## Goal

Find range of plausible values for the slope using bootstrap confidence intervals.

## Packages

#| label: packages
#| echo: true
#| message: false
# load packages

library(tidymodels)  # for modeling

## Data: Houses in Duke Forest {.smaller}

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Data on houses that were sold in the Duke Forest neighborhood of Durham, NC around November 2020
-   Scraped from Zillow
-   Source: [`openintro::duke_forest`](http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro/reference/duke_forest.html)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/21/duke_forest_home.jpg){fig-alt="Home in Duke Forest"}
:::
:::::

**Goal**: Use the area (in square feet) to understand variability in the price of houses in Duke Forest.

## Exploratory data analysis

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
ggplot(duke_forest, aes(x = area, y = price)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(
    x = "Area (square feet)",
    y = "Sale price (USD)",
    title = "Price and area of houses in Duke Forest"
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_dollar()) 
```

## Modeling {.smaller}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "|5|6"

df_fit <- linear_reg() |>
  fit(price ~ area, data = duke_forest)

tidy(df_fit) |>
  kable(digits = 2) # neatly format table to 2 digits
```

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: false
intercept <- tidy(df_fit) |> filter(term == "(Intercept)") |> pull(estimate) |> round()
slope <- tidy(df_fit) |> filter(term == "area") |> pull(estimate) |> round()
```

-   **Intercept:** Duke Forest houses that are 0 square feet are expected to sell, for `r dollar(intercept)`, on average.
    -   Is this interpretation useful?
-   **Slope:** For each additional square foot, we expect the sale price of Duke Forest houses to be higher by `r dollar(slope)`, on average.

## From sample to population {.smaller}

> For each additional square foot, we expect the sale price of Duke Forest houses to be higher by `r dollar(slope)`, on average.

<br>

-   This estimate is valid for the single sample of `r nrow(duke_forest)` houses.
-   But what if we're not interested quantifying the relationship between the size and price of a house in this single sample?
-   What if we want to say something about the relationship between these variables for all houses in Duke Forest?

## Statistical inference {.smaller}

-   **Statistical inference** provide methods and tools so we can use the single observed sample to make valid statements (inferences) about the population it comes from

-   For our inferences to be valid, the sample should be random and representative of the population we're interested in

![](images/21/soup.png)

## Inference for simple linear regression

-   Calculate a confidence interval for the slope, $\beta_1$ (today)

-   Conduct a hypothesis test for the slope,$\beta_1$ (next week)

# Confidence interval for the slope

## Confidence interval {.smaller}

::: incremental
-   A plausible range of values for a population parameter is called a **confidence interval**
-   Using only a single point estimate is like fishing in a murky lake with a spear, and using a confidence interval is like fishing with a net
    -   We can throw a spear where we saw a fish but we will probably miss, if we toss a net in that area, we have a good chance of catching the fish
    -   Similarly, if we report a point estimate, we probably will not hit the exact population parameter, but if we report a range of plausible values we have a good shot at capturing the parameter
:::

## Confidence interval for the slope {.smaller}

A confidence interval will allow us to make a statement like "*For each additional square foot, the model predicts the sale price of Duke Forest houses to be higher, on average, by `r dollar(slope)`, plus or minus X dollars.*"

. . .

-   Should X be \$10?
    \$100?
    \$1000?

-   If we were to take another sample of `r nrow(duke_forest)` would we expect the slope calculated based on that sample to be exactly `r dollar(slope)`?
    Off by \$10?
    \$100?
    \$1000?

-   The answer depends on how variable (from one sample to another sample) the sample statistic (the slope) is

-   We need a way to quantify the variability of the sample statistic

## Quantify the variability of the slope {.smaller}

**for estimation**

::: incremental
-   Two approaches:
    1.  Via simulation (what we'll do in this course)
    2.  Via mathematical models (what you can learn about in future courses)
-   **Bootstrapping** to quantify the variability of the slope for the purpose of estimation:
    -   Bootstrap new samples from the original sample
    -   Fit models to each of the samples and estimate the slope
    -   Use features of the distribution of the bootstrapped slopes to construct a confidence interval

## Recap {.xsmall}

-   **Population:** Complete set of observations of whatever we are studying, e.g., people, tweets, photographs, etc. (population size = $N$)

-   **Sample:** Subset of the population, ideally random and representative (sample size = $n$)

-   Sample statistic $\ne$ population parameter, but if the sample is good, it can be a good estimate

-   **Statistical inference:** Discipline that concerns itself with the development of procedures, methods, and theorems that allow us to extract meaning and information from data that has been generated by stochastic (random) process

-   We report the estimate with a confidence interval, and the width of this interval depends on the variability of sample statistics from different samples from the population

-   Since we can't continue sampling from the population, we bootstrap from the one sample we have to estimate sampling variability
