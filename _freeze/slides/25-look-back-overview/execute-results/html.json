Summary {.smaller}\n\n-   Represent percentages as parts of a whole\n-   Place variables representing time on the x-axis when possible\n-   Pay attention to data types, e.g., represent time as time on a continuous scale, not years as levels of a categorical variable\n-   Prefer direct labeling over legends\n-   Use accessible colors\n-   Use color to draw attention\n-   Pick a purpose and label, color, annotate for that purpose\n-   Communicate your main message directly in the plot labels\n-   Simplify before you call it done (a.k.a. \"Before you leave the house, look in the mirror and take one thing off\")\n",
