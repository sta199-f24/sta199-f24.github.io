You should now see the RStudio environment.\n\n### Step 2: Clone the repo & start new RStudio project\n\n-   Go to the course organization at [github.com/sta199-f24](https://github.com/sta199-f24) organization on GitHub.\n    Click on the repo with the prefix **lab-2**.\n    It contains the starter documents you need to complete the lab.\n\n-   Click on the green **CODE** button, select **Use SSH** (this might already be selected by default, and if it is, you'll see the text **Clone with SSH**).\n    Click on the clipboard icon to copy the repo URL.\n\n-   In RStudio, go to *File* ➛ *New Project* ➛*Version Control* ➛ *Git*.\n\n-   Copy and paste the URL of your assignment repo into the dialog box *Repository URL*. Again, please make sure to have *SSH* highlighted under *Clone* when you copy the address.\n\n-   Click *Create Project*, and the files from your GitHub repo will be displayed in the *Files* pane in RStudio.\n\n-   Click *lab-2.qmd* to open the template Quarto file.\n    This is where you will write up your code and narrative for the lab.\n\n### Step 3: Update the YAML\n\nIn `lab-2.qmd`, update the `author` field to your name, render your document and examine the changes.\nThen, in the Git pane, click on **Diff** to view your changes, add a commit message (e.g., \"Added author name\"), and click **Commit**.\nThen, push the changes to your GitHub repository, and in your browser confirm that these changes have indeed propagated to your repository.\n:::\n\n::: callout-important\nIf you run into any issues with the first steps outlined above, flag a TA for help before proceeding.\n:::\n\n## Packages\n\nIn this lab we will work with the **tidyverse** package, which is a collection of packages for doing data analysis in a \"tidy\" way.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n-   **Run** the code cell by clicking on the green triangle (play) button for the code cell labeled `load-packages`. This loads the package to make its features (the functions and datasets in it) be accessible from your *Console*.\n-   Then, **render** the document which loads this package to make its features (the functions and datasets in it) be available for other code cells in your Quarto document.\n\n## Guidelines\n\nAs we've discussed in lecture, your plots should include an informative title, axes and legends should have human-readable labels, and careful consideration should be given to aesthetic choices.\n\nAdditionally, code should follow the [tidyverse style](https://style.tidyverse.org/).\nParticularly,\n\n-   there should be spaces before and line breaks after each `+` when building a `ggplot`,\n\n-   there should also be spaces before and line breaks after each `|>` in a data transformation pipeline,\n\n-   code should be properly indented,\n\n-   there should be spaces around `=` signs and spaces after commas.\n\nFurthermore, all code should be visible in the PDF output, i.e., should not run off the page on the PDF.\nLong lines that run off the page should be split across multiple lines with line breaks.\n\nRemember that continuing to develop a sound workflow for reproducible data analysis is important as you complete the lab and other assignments in this course.\nThere will be periodic reminders in this assignment to remind you to **render, commit, and push** your changes to GitHub.\n\n::: callout-important\nContinuing to develop a sound workflow for reproducible data analysis is important as you complete the lab and other assignments in this course.\nThere will be periodic reminders in this assignment to remind you to **render, commit, and push** your changes to GitHub.\nYou should have at least 3 commits with meaningful commit messages by the end of the assignment.\n:::\n\n# Questions\n\n## Part 1\n\n**Inflation across the world**\n\nFor this part of the analysis you will work with inflation data from various countries in the world over the last 30 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncountry_inflation <- read_csv(\"data/country-inflation.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n### Question 1\n\nGet to know the data.\n\na.  `glimpse()` at the `country_inflation` data frame and answer the following questions based on the output.\n    How many rows does `country_inflation` have and what does each row represent?\n    How many columns does `country_inflation` have and what does each column represent?\n\nb.  Display a list of the unique countries included in the dataset.\n\n::: callout-tip\nA function that can be useful for part (b) is `pull()`.\nCheck out its documentation for examples of usage.\n:::\n\n### Question 2\n\nWhich countries had the top three highest inflation rates in 2023?\nYour output should be a data frame with two columns, `country` and `2021`, with inflation rates in descending order, and three rows for the top three countries.\nBriefly comment on how the inflation rates for these countries compare to the inflation rate for United States in that year.\n\n::: callout-tip\nColumn names that are numbers are not considered \"proper\" in R, therefore to select them you'll need to surround them with backticks, e.g. `select(` `` ` `` `1993` `` ` `` `)`.\n:::\n\n### Question 3\n\nIn a single pipeline,\n\n-   calculate the ratio of the inflation in 2023 and inflation in 1993 for each country and store this information in a new column called `inf_ratio`,\n-   arrange the data frame in decreasing order of `inf_ratio`, and\n-   select the variables `country` and `inf_ratio` to display as the result of the pipeline.\n\nDo not save this new variable in `inf_ratio`, only calculate and display it so you can answer the following question based on the output of the pipeline.\n\nWhich country's inflation change is the largest over this time period?\nDid inflation increase of decrease between 1993 and 2023 in this country?\n\n::: callout-tip\nFor this question you'll once again need to use variables whose names are numbers (years) in your pipeline.\nMake sure to surround the names of such variables with backticks (`` ` ``).\n:::\n\n### Question 4\n\nReshape (pivot) `country_inflation` such that each row represents a country/year combination, with columns `country`, `year`, and `annual_inflation`.\nThen, display the resulting data frame and state how many rows and columns it has.\n\nRequirements:\n\n-   Your code must use one of `pivot_longer()` or `pivot_wider()`. There are other ways you can do this reshaping move in R, but this question requires solving this problem by pivoting.\n-   In your `pivot_*()` function, you must use `names_transform = as.numeric` as an argument to transform the variable type to numeric as you pivot the data so that in the resulting data frame the year variable is numeric.\n-   The resulting data frame must be saved as something other than `country_inflation` so you (1) can refer to this data frame later in your analysis and (2) do not overwrite `country_inflation`. Use a short but informative name.\n\n::: callout-important\nThe remaining questions in Part 1 require the use of the pivoted data frame from Question 4.\n:::\n\n### Question 5\n\nUse a separate, single pipeline to answer each of the following questions.\n\nRequirement: Your code must use the `filter()` function for each part, not `arrange()`.\n\na.  What is the highest inflation rate observed between 1993 and 2023?\n    The output of the pipeline should be a data frame with one row and three columns.\n    In addition to code and output, your response should include a single sentence stating the country and year.\n\nb.  What is the lowest inflation rate observed between 1993 and 2023?\n    The output of the pipeline should be a data frame with one row and three columns.\n    In addition to code and output, your response should include a single sentence stating the country and year.\n\nc.  Putting (a) and (b) together: What are the highest and the lowest inflation rates observed between 1993 and 2023?\n    The output of the pipeline should be a data frame with two rows and three columns.\n\n### Question 6\n\na\\.\nCreate a vector called `countries_of_interest` which contains the names of up tp five countries you want to visualize the inflation rates for over the years.\nFor example, if these countries are Türkiye and United States, you can express this as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncountries_of_interest <- c(\"Türkiye\", \"United States\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nIf they are Türkiye, United States, and Chile, you can express this as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncountries_of_interest <- c(\n  \"Türkiye\", \"United States\", \"Chile\"\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nSo on and so forth...\nThen, in 1-2 sentences, state why you chose these countries.\n\n::: callout-note\nYour `countries_of_interest` should consist of no more than five countries.\nMake sure that the spelling of your countries matches how they appear in the dataset.\n:::\n\nb\\.\nIn a single pipeline, filter your reshaped dataset to include only the `countries_of_interest` from part (a), and save the resulting data frame with a new name so you (1) can refer to this data frame later in your analysis and (2) do not overwrite the data frame you're starting with.\nUse a short but informative name.\nThen, in a new pipeline, find the `distinct()` countries in the data frame you created.\n\n::: callout-tip\nThe number of distinct countries in the filtered data frame you created in part (b) should equal the number of countries you chose in part (a).\nIf it doesn't, you might have misspelled a country name or made a mistake in how to filter for these countries.\nGo back and check your code.\n:::\n\n### Question 7\n\nUsing your data frame from the previous question, create a plot of annual inflation vs. year for these countries.\nThen, in a few sentences, describe the patterns you observe in the plot, particularly focusing on anything you find surprising or not surprising, based on your knowledge (or lack thereof) of these countries economies.\n\nRequirements for the plot:\n\n-   Data should be represented with points as well as lines connecting the points for each country.\n-   Each country should be represented by a different color line and different color and shape points.\n-   Axes and legend should be properly labeled.\n-   The plot should have an appropriate title (and optionally a subtitle).\n-   Plot should be customized in at least one way – you could use a different than default color scale, or different than default theme, or some other customization.\n\n::: render-commit-push\nIf you haven't yet done so, now is a good time to render, commit, and push.\nMake sure that you commit and push all changed documents and your Git pane is completely empty before proceeding.\n:::\n\n## Part 2\n\n**Inflation in the US**\n\nThe OECD defines inflation as follows:\n\n> Inflation is a rise in the general level of prices of goods and services that households acquire for the purpose of consumption in an economy over a period of time.\n>\n> The main measure of inflation is the annual inflation rate which is the movement of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) from one month/period to the same month/period of the previous year expressed as percentage over time.\n>\n> Source: [OECD CPI FAQ](https://www.oecd.org/sdd/prices-ppp/consumerpriceindices-frequentlyaskedquestionsfaqs.htm#1)\n\nCPI is broken down into 12 divisions such as food, housing, health, etc.\nYour goal in this part is to create another time series plot of annual inflation, this time for US only.\n\nThe data you will need to create this visualization is spread across two files:\n\n-   `us-inflation.csv`: Annual inflation rate for the US for 12 CPI divisions. Each division is identified by an ID number.\n-   `cpi-divisions.csv`: A \"lookup table\" of CPI division ID numbers and their descriptions.\n\nLet's load both of these files.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nus_inflation <- read_csv(\"data/us-inflation.csv\")\ncpi_divisions <- read_csv(\"data/cpi-divisions.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n### Question 8\n\na\\.\nHow many columns and how many rows does the `us_inflation` dataset have?\nWhat are the variables in it?\nAdd a brief (1-2 sentences) narrative summarizing this information.\n\nb\\.\nHow many columns and how many rows does the `cpi_divisions` dataset have?\nWhat are the variables in it?\nAdd a brief (1-2 sentences) narrative summarizing this information.\n\nc\\.\nCreate a new dataset by joining the `us_inflation` dataset with the `cpi_division_id` dataset.\n\n-   Determine which type of join is the most appropriate one and use that.\n\n-   Note that the two datasets don't have a common variable.\n    Review the help for the join functions to determine how to use the `by` argument when the names of the variables that the datasets should be joined by are different.\n\n-   Use a short but informative name for the joined dataset, and do not overwrite either of the datasets that go into creating it.\n\nThen, find the number of rows and columns of the resulting dataset and report the names of its columns.\nAdd a brief (1-2 sentences) narrative summarizing this information.\n\n### Question 9\n\na\\.\nCreate a vector called `divisions_of_interest` which contains the descriptions or IDs of CPI divisions you want to visualize.\nYour `divisions_of_interest` should consist of no more than five divisions.\nIf you're using descriptions, make sure that the spelling of your divisions matches how they appear in the dataset.\nThen, in 1-2 sentences, state why you chose these divisions.\n\n::: callout-tip\nRefer back to the guidance provided in [Question 6] if you're not sure how to create this vector.\n:::\n\nb\\.\nIn a single pipeline, filter your reshaped dataset to include only the `divisions_of_interest` from part (a), and save the resulting data frame with a new name so you (1) can refer to this data frame later in your analysis and (2) do not overwrite the data frame you're starting with.\nUse a short but informative name.\nThen, in a new pipeline, find the `distinct()` divisions in the data frame you created.\n\n### Question 10\n\nUsing your data frame from the previous question, create a plot of annual inflation vs. year for these divisions.\nThen, in a few sentences, describe the patterns you observe in the plot, particularly focusing on anything you find surprising or not surprising, based on your knowledge (or lack thereof) of inflation rates in the US over the last decade.\n\n-   Data should be represented with points as well as lines connecting the points for each division.\n-   Each division should be represented by a different color line and different color and shape points.\n-   Axes and legend should be properly labeled.\n-   The plot should have an appropriate title (and optionally a subtitle).\n-   Plot should be customized in at least one way – you could use a different than default color scale, or different than default theme, or some other customization.\n-   If your legend has labels that are too long, you can try moving the legend to the bottom and stack the labels vertically. *Hint:* The `legend.position` and `legend.direction` arguments of the `theme()` functions will be useful.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(...) +\n  ... +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"bottom\", \n    legend.direction = \"vertical\"\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n::: render-commit-push\nIf you haven't yet done so since Part 1, now is a good time to render, commit, and push.\nMake sure that you commit and push all changed documents and your Git pane is completely empty before proceeding.\n:::\n\n# Wrap-up\n\n## Submission\n\nOnce you are finished with the lab, you will submit your final PDF document to Gradescope.\n\n::: callout-warning\nBefore you wrap up the assignment, make sure all of your documents are updated on your GitHub repo.\nWe will be checking these to make sure you have been practicing how to commit and push changes.\n\nYou must turn in a PDF file to the Gradescope page by the submission deadline to be considered \"on time\".\n:::\n\nTo submit your assignment:\n\n-   Go to <http://www.gradescope.com> and click *Log in* in the top right corner.\n-   Click *School Credentials* $\\rightarrow$ *Duke NetID* and log in using your NetID credentials.\n-   Click on your *STA 199* course.\n-   Click on the assignment, and you'll be prompted to submit it.\n-   Mark all the pages associated with question. All the pages of your lab should be associated with at least one question (i.e., should be \"checked\").\n\n::: callout-important\n## Checklist\n\nMake sure you have:\n\n-   attempted all questions\n-   rendered your Quarto document\n-   committed and pushed everything to your GitHub repository such that the Git pane in RStudio is empty\n-   uploaded your PDF to Gradescope\n-   selected pages associated with each question on Gradescope\n:::\n\n## Grading and feedback\n\n-   Some of the questions will be graded for accuracy.\n\n-   Some will be graded for completion.\n\n-   There are also workflow points, for coding style, for committing at least three times as you work through your lab, and for overall organization.\n\n-   You'll receive feedback on your lab on Gradescope within a week.\n",
