You should now see the RStudio environment.\n\n### Step 2: Clone the repo & start a new RStudio project\n\n-   Go to the course organization at [github.com/sta199-f24](https://github.com/sta199-f24) organization on GitHub.\n    Click on the repo with the prefix **lab-6**.\n    It contains the starter documents you need to complete the lab.\n\n-   Click on the green **CODE** button and select **Use SSH**. This might already be selected by default; if it is, you'll see the text **Clone with SSH**.\n    Click on the clipboard icon to copy the repo URL.\n\n-   In RStudio, go to *File* ➛ *New Project* ➛*Version Control* ➛ *Git*.\n\n-   Copy and paste the URL of your assignment repo into the dialog box *Repository URL*. Again, please make sure to have *SSH* highlighted under *Clone* when you copy the address.\n\n-   Click *Create Project*, and the files from your GitHub repo will be displayed in the *Files* pane in RStudio.\n\n-   Click *lab-6.qmd* to open the template Quarto file.\n    This is where you will write up your code and narrative for the lab.\n\n### Step 3: Update the YAML\n\nIn `lab-6.qmd`, update the `author` field to your name, render your document and examine the changes.\nThen, in the Git pane, click on **Diff** to view your changes, add a commit message (e.g., \"Added author name\"), and click **Commit**.\nThen, push the changes to your GitHub repository, and in your browser confirm that these changes have indeed propagated to your repository.\n:::\n\n::: callout-important\nIf you run into any issues with the first steps outlined above, flag a TA for help before proceeding.\n:::\n\n## Packages\n\nIn this lab, we will work with the\n\n-   **tidyverse** package for doing data analysis in a \"tidy\" way,\n-   **tidymodels** package for modeling in a \"tidy\" way, and\n-   **openintro** package for the dataset for Part 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidymodels)\nlibrary(openintro)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n-   **Run** the code cell by clicking on the green triangle (play) button for the code cell labeled `load-packages`. This loads the package so that its features (the functions and datasets in it) are accessible from your *Console*.\n-   Then, **render** the document that loads this package to make its features (the functions and datasets in it) available for other code cells in your Quarto document.\n\n## Guidelines\n\n\nAs we've discussed in lecture, your plots should include an informative title, axes and legends should have human-readable labels, and careful consideration should be given to aesthetic choices.\n\nAdditionally, code should follow the [tidyverse style](https://style.tidyverse.org/).\nParticularly,\n\n-   there should be spaces before and line breaks after each `+` when building a `ggplot`,\n\n-   there should also be spaces before and line breaks after each `|>` in a data transformation pipeline,\n\n-   code should be properly indented,\n\n-   there should be spaces around `=` signs and spaces after commas.\n\nFurthermore, all code should be visible in the PDF output, i.e., should not run off the page on the PDF.\nLong lines that run off the page should be split across multiple lines with line breaks.\n\n::: callout-important\nContinuing to develop a sound workflow for reproducible data analysis is important as you complete the lab and other assignments in this course.\nThere will be periodic reminders in this assignment to remind you to **render, commit, and push** your changes to GitHub.\nYou should have at least 3 commits with meaningful commit messages by the end of the assignment.\n:::\n\n\n\n::: callout-important\nYou are also expected to pay attention to [code smell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell) in addition to code style and readability.\nYou should review and improve your code to avoid redundant steps (e.g., grouping, ungrouping, and grouping again by the same variable in a pipeline), using inconsistent syntax (e.g., `!` to say \"not\" in one place and `-` in another place), etc.\n:::\n\n# Part 1 - Life expectancy and GDP\n\nGapminder is a “fact tank” that uses publicly available world data to produce data visualizations and teaching resources on global development.\nWe will use an excerpt of their data to explore relationships among world health metrics across countries and regions between the years 2000 and 2023.\nThe data set is called `gapminder` and it's in your lab repository's `data` folder.\nA table of variables can be found below.\n\n-   `country`: The country name\n\n-   `continent`: The continent name\n\n-   `year`: Year of data\n\n-   `life_exp`: life expectancy at birth, in years\n\n-   `gdp_percap`: Gross domestic product per person adjusted for differences in purchasing power (in international dollars, fixed 2017 prices)\n\n## Question 1\n\nIn this question you'll prepare the dataset you'll use in this part.\n\na.  **Read:** Read the data and save it as an object called `gapminder_raw`.\n\nb.  **Filter:** For our analysis, we will only be working with data from 2023.\n    Filter the data set so only values from the year 2023 are included.\n    Save this data set as `gapminder_raw_23` and use it for the remainder of this exercise and the following.\n\nc.  **Glimpse:** Glimpse at `gapminder_raw_23` and list the variables and their types.\n    Comment on any unexpected features in the data.\n\nd.  **Clean:** First, figure out why `gdp_percap` is read in as a character variable and describe your findings in one sentence.\n    Then, clean the `gdp_percap` variable and convert it to numeric values.\n    Save the resulting data frame as `gapminder_23`.\n\n## Question 2\n\nWe are interested in learning more about life expectancy in countries, and we’ll start by exploring the relationship between life expectancy and GDP.\nCreate two visualizations:\n\n-   Scatter plot of `life_exp` vs. `gdp_percap`\n\n-   Scatter plot of `life_exp_log` vs. `gdp_percap`, where `life_exp_log` is a new variable you add to the data set by taking the natural log of `life_exp`.\n\nFirst describe the relationship between each pair of the variables.\nThen, comment on which relationship would be better modeled using a linear model, and explain your reasoning.\n\n::: callout-note\nThe question isn't asking which of these relationships is clearly linear, but instead which would be better modeled using a linear model.\n:::\n\n## Question 3\n\na.  **Data Prep:** What happens when you take the natural log of 0?\n    Remove rows of your data set where life_expectancy = 0, justifying why this is helpful.\n\nb.  **Model fitting:** Fit a linear model predicting log life expectancy from gross domestic product.\n    Display the tidy summary.\n\nc.  **Model evaluation:**\n\n    -   Calculate the R-squared of the model using two methods and confirm that the values match: first method is using `glance()` and the other method is based on the value of the correlation coefficient between the two variables.\n\n    -   Interpret R-squared in the context of the data and the research question.\n\n## Question 4\n\nNext, we want to examine if the relationship between life expectancy and GDP that we observed in the previous exercise holds across all continents in our data.\nWe’ll continue to work with logged life expectancy (`life_exp_log`) and data from 2023.\n\na.  **Justification:** Create a scatter plot of `life_exp_log` vs. `gdp_percap`, where the points are colored by `continent`.\n    Do you think the trend between `life_exp_log` and `gdp_percap` is different for different continents?\n    Justify your answer with specific features of the plot.\n\nb.  **Model fitting and interpretation:**\n\n    -   Regardless of your answer in part (a), fit an [additive model]{.underline} (main effects) that predicts `life_exp_log` from GDP per capita and continent (with Africas as the baseline level).\n        Display a tidy summary of the model output.\n\n    -   Interpret the *intercept* of the model, making sure that your interpretation is in the units of the original data (not on log scale).\n\n    -   Interpret the *slope* of the model, making sure that your interpretation is in the units of the original data (not on log scale).\n\nc.  **Prediction:** Predict the life expectacy of a country in Asia where the average GDP per capita is \\$70,000.\n    Do this using R functions, not by manually plugging in numbers.\n\n## Question 5\n\nCommunication is a critical yet often overlooked part of data science.\nWhen we engage with our audience and capture their interest, we can ultimately better communicate what we are trying to share.\n\nPlease watch the following video: [Hans Rosling: 200 years in 4 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8t4k0Q8e8Y).\n\nThen, write a paragraph (4-5 sentences) addressing the following:\n\n-   What did you enjoy about the presentation of data?\n    What did you find interesting\n\n-   Were there any aspects of the presentation that were hard to follow?\n    If so, what?\n\n-   What are your general take-aways from this presentation?\n\n-   What are your general take-aways from how this presentation was given?\n\n# Part 2 - Bike rentals\n\nBike sharing systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where whole process from membership, rental and return back has become automatic.\nYou are tasked to investigate the relationship between the temperature outside and the number of bikes rented in the Washington DC area between the years 2011 and 2022.\nYou will be investigating data for the months June, July, September, and November.[^1]\n\n[^1]: Data subset from Progress in Artificial Intelligence, 2013.\n\nThe dataset is called `bike.csv` and it's in your lab repository's `data` folder.\n\nBelow is a list of variables and their definitions:\n\n+-------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Variable    | Definition                                                                     |\n+:============+:===============================================================================+\n| `season`    | Numerical representation of Spring (2), Summer (3), and Fall (4)               |\n+-------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| `year`      | Numerical representation of 2011 (0) or 2012 (1)                               |\n+-------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| `month`     | Month in which data were collected                                             |\n+-------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| `holiday`   | Indicator variable for whether data were collected on a holiday (1) or not (0) |\n+-------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| `weekday`   | Numerical representation of day of week                                        |\n+-------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| `temp`      | Temperature in Celsius                                                         |\n+-------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| `count`     | Number of bike rentals for that day                                            |\n+-------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n## Question 6\n\na.  Read in the data.\n    Then, create a scatter plot that investigates the relationship between the number of bikes rented and the temperature outside.\n    Include a straight line of best fit to help discuss the discovered relationship.\n    Summarize your findings in at most 4 sentences.\n\nb.  Another researcher suggests to look at the relationship between bikes rented and temperature by each of the four months of interest.\n    Recreate your plot in part a, and color the points by month.\n    Include a straight line for each of the four months to help discuss each month's relationship between bikes rented and temperature.\n    Summarize your findings in at most 4 sentences.\n\nWatch the following video on Simpson's Paradox [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebEkn-BiW5k).\nAfter you do, please answer the following questions.\n\nc.  In your own words, summarize Simpson's Paradox in at most 4 sentences.\n\nd.  Compare and contrast your findings from part (a) and part (b).\n    What's different?\n\ne.  Think critically about your answer to part d.\n    What other context from this study could be creating this paradox?\n    That is, identify a potential confounding variable in this study.\n    Be sure to justify how your example could be a potential confounding variable by relating it back to both bike rentals and temperature.\n\n# Part 3 - Do you even lift?\n\nIn this part, you will be working with data from [www.openpowerlifting.org](https://www.openpowerlifting.org/).\nThis data was sourced from [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-10-08) and contains international powerlifting records at various meets.\nAt each meet, each lifter gets three attempts at lifting max weight on three lifts: the bench press, squat and deadlift.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nipf <- read_csv(\"data/ipf.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data dictionary for this dataset from TidyTuesday is reproduced below:\n\n+--------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| variable           | description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n+:===================+:================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================+\n| `name`             | Individual lifter name                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n+--------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| `sex`              | Binary gender (M/F)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n+--------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| `event`            | The type of competition that the lifter entered.
