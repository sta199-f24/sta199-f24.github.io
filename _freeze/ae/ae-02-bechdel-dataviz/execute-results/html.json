We first specify the data set we will use with `data = bechdel`.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = bechdel)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ae-02-bechdel-dataviz_files/figure-html/plot-base-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n-   The `mapping` argument is paired with an aesthetic (`aes()`), which tells us how the variables in our data set should be mapped to the visual properties of the graph.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = bechdel, mapping = aes(x = clean_test))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ae-02-bechdel-dataviz_files/figure-html/plot-aesthetic-mapping-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we previously mentioned, we often omit the names of the first two arguments in R functions.\nSo you'll often see this written as:\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(bechdel, aes(x = clean_test))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ae-02-bechdel-dataviz_files/figure-html/plot-simplified-call-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the result is exactly the same.\n\n-   The `geom_xx` function specifies the type of plot we want to use to represent the data. In the code below, we use `geom_point` which creates a plot where each observation is represented by a point.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(bechdel, aes(x = clean_test)) +\n  geom_bar()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ae-02-bechdel-dataviz_files/figure-html/plot-point-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat types of movies are more common, those that pass or do not pass the test?\n\n### Render, commit, and push\n\n1.
