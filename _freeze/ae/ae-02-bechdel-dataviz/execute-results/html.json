Let's read it from there and save it as an object called `bechdel`.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbechdel <- read_csv(\"data/bechdel.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n### Get to know the data\n\nWe can use the `glimpse()` function to get an overview (or \"glimpse\") of the data.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n-   What does each observation (row) in the data set represent?\n\nEach observation represents a ___.\n\n-   How many observations (rows) are in the data set?\n\nThere are ___ movies in the dataset.\n\n-   How many variables (columns) are in the data set?\n\nThere are ___ columns in the dataset.\n\n### Variables of interest\n\nThe variables we'll focus on are the following:\n\n-   `roi`: Return on investment, calculated as the ratio of the gross to budget.\n-   `clean_test`: Bechdel test result:\n    -   `ok` = passes test\n    -   `dubious`\n    -   `men` = women only talk about men\n    -   `notalk` = women don't talk to each other\n    -   `nowomen` = fewer than two women\n-   `binary`: Bechdel Test PASS vs FAIL binary\n\nWe will also use the `year` of release in data prep and `title` of movie to take a deeper look at some outliers.\n\nThere are a few other variables in the dataset, but we won't be using them in this analysis.\n\n## Bechdel test results\n\n### Visualizing data with **ggplot2**\n\n**ggplot2** is the package and `ggplot()` is the function in this package that is used to create a plot.\n\n-   `ggplot()` creates the initial base coordinate system, and we will add layers to that base. We first specify the data set we will use with `data = bechdel`.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = bechdel)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ae-02-bechdel-dataviz_files/figure-html/plot-base-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n-   The `mapping` argument is paired with an aesthetic (`aes()`), which tells us how the variables in our data set should be mapped to the visual properties of the graph.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = bechdel, mapping = aes(x = clean_test))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ae-02-bechdel-dataviz_files/figure-html/plot-aesthetic-mapping-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nAs we previously mentioned, we often omit the names of the first two arguments in R functions. So you'll often see this written as:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(bechdel, aes(x = clean_test))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ae-02-bechdel-dataviz_files/figure-html/plot-simplified-call-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nNote that the result is exactly the same.\n\n-   The `geom_xx` function specifies the type of plot we want to use to represent the data. In the code below, we use `geom_point` which creates a plot where each observation is represented by a point.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(bechdel, aes(x = clean_test)) +\n  geom_bar()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ae-02-bechdel-dataviz_files/figure-html/plot-point-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nWhat types of movies are more common, those that pass or do not pass the test?\n\n### Render, commit, and push\n\n1.

Once your updated files are in your repo on GitHub, you're good to go!\n\n## Return-on-investment\n\nLet's take a look at return-on-investment (ROI) for movies that do and do not pass the Bechdel test.\n\n### Step 1 - Your turn\n\nCreate side-by-side box plots of `roi` by `clean_test` where the boxes are colored by `binary`.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nWhat are those movies with *very* high returns on investment?\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbechdel |>\n  filter(roi > 400) |>\n  select(title, roi, budget_2013, gross_2013, year, clean_test)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 3 Ã— 6\n  title                     roi budget_2013 gross_2013  year clean_test\n  <chr>                   <dbl>       <dbl>      <dbl> <dbl> <chr>     \n1 Paranormal Activity      671.      505595  339424558  2007 dubious   \n2 The Blair Witch Project  648.      839077  543776715  1999 ok        \n3 El Mariachi              583.       11622    6778946  1992 nowomen   \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### Step 2 - Demo\n\nExpand on your plot from the previous step to zoom in on movies with `roi < ___` to get a better view of how the medians across the categories compare.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nWhat does this plot say about return-on-investment on movies that pass the Bechdel test?\n\n### Render, commit, and push\n\n1.
