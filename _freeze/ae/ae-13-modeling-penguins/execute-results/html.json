It's bounded by -1 and 1.*\n\n    -   Are you good at guessing correlation?\n        Give it a try!\n        <https://www.rossmanchance.com/applets/2021/guesscorrelation/GuessCorrelation.html>\n-   **Demo:** What is the correlation between flipper length and body mass of penguins?\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n# Defining, fitting, and summarizing a model\n\n-   **Demo:** Write the population model below that explains the relationship between body mass and flipper length.\n\n$$\nadd~math~text~here\n$$\n\n-   **Demo:** Fit the linear regression model and display the results.
