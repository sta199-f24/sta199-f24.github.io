Under this heading you’ll find an entry called Container Manager (CMGR Coursework Containers).\n\nIf the status shows something other than Operational, this means there is a known incident with the containers. Check back later to see if it’s been resolved. If there’s a deadline coming up soon, post on the Ed Discussions to let us know that there’s an issue. We can look into how quickly it might get resolved and decide on what to do about the deadline accordingly. Note: We don’t anticipate this to happen regularly, the systems are Operational a huge majority of the time!\nIf the status shows Operational, this means the system is expected to be working. Check your internet connection, if need be, restart your computer to ensure a fresh new connection. If your issue persists, post on the course forum with details on what you’ve tried and the errors you see (including verbatim errors and/or screenshots).\n\nAnother approach is to request a restart of your container. To do so, select your container as you usually do and then, instead of Login, click on Request Restart. Read the warning in the next page, and then click once more to restart your container.",

While we won’t be covering making slides with Quarto in the class, we would be happy to help you with it in office hours. It’s no different than writing other documents with Quarto, so the learning curve will not be steep!\nThe slide deck should be roughly 6 content slides + 1 title slide.

    "text": "Can I use a local install of R and RStudio instead of using the RStudio containers?\nThe short answer is, I’d rather you didn’t, to save yourself some headache. But, the long answer is, sure! But you will need to install a specific versions of R and RStudio for everything to work as expected. You will also need to install the R packages we’re using as well as have Git installed on your computer. These are not extremely challenging things to get right, but they are not trivial either, particularly on certain operating systems. Myself and the TAs are always happy to provide help with any computational questions when you’re working in the containers we have provided for you. If you’re working on your local setup, we can’t guarantee being able to resolve your issues, though we’re happy to try.\nIf you want to take this path, here is what you need to do:\n\nDownload and install R 4.4.1: https://cran.r-project.org/\nDownload and install RStudio: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/\nInstall Quarto 1.5.56 or higher: https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/\nInstall Git: https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html\nInstall any necessary packages with install.packages(\"___\")\n\nAnd I’d like to reiterate again that successful installation of these software is not a learning goal of this course. So if any of this seems tedious or intimidating in any way, just use the computing environment we have set up for you. More on that here.",

I intend to present materials and activities that respect diversity and align with Duke’s Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups.\nFurthermore, I would like to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives, and experiences and honors their identities. To help accomplish this:\n\nIf you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and talk with me. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your academic dean is an excellent resource.\nI (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities.

Your TAs and I will help you by providing you with materials answering questions, and setting a pace, but for this to work, you must do the following:\n\nComplete all the preparation work before class.\nAsk questions. As often as you can. In class, out of class. Ask me, ask the TAs, ask your friends, ask the person sitting next to you. This will help you more than anything else. If you get a question wrong on an assessment, ask us why. If you’re not sure about the lab, ask. If you hear something on the news that sounds related to what we discussed, ask. If the reading is confusing, ask.\nDo the readings.\nDo the lab. The earlier you start, the better. It’s not enough to just mechanically plow through the exercises. You should ask yourself how these exercises relate to earlier material and imagine how they might be changed (to make questions for an exam, for example).\nDon’t procrastinate. The content builds upon what was taught in previous weeks, so if something is confusing to you in Week 2, Week 3 will become more confusing, Week 4 even worse, etc. Don’t let the week end with unanswered questions. But if you find yourself falling behind and not knowing where to begin asking, come to office hours and work with a member of the teaching team to help you identify a good (re)starting point.",

    "text": "Course components\n\nLectures and labs\nLectures and labs are designed to be interactive, so you gain experience applying new concepts and learning from each other. My role as instructor is to introduce you to new methods, tools, and techniques, but it is up to you to take them and use them. A lot of what you do in this course will involve writing code, and coding is a skill that is best learned by doing. Therefore, as much as possible, you will work on various tasks and activities throughout each lecture and lab. You are expected to prepare for class by completing assigned readings, attending lectures and lab sessions, and meaningfully contributing to in-class exercises and discussions. Additionally, most lectures will feature application exercises that will be graded based on completing what we do in class.\nYou are expected to bring a laptop (or Chromebook) to each class so that you can participate in the in-class exercises. Please ensure your device is fully charged before you come to class, as the number of outlets in the classroom will not be sufficient to accommodate everyone. A tablet also works, but the user experience will be much smoother on a laptop.\n\n\nTeams\nYou will be assigned to a team early on in the semester. You are encouraged to sit with your teammates in lectures, and you will also work with them in some of the lab sessions. All team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of the project, and you will be asked to evaluate your team members throughout the semester. Failure to adequately contribute to any project component will result in a penalty to your mark relative to the team’s overall mark.\nYou are expected to use the provided GitHub repository as the central collaborative platform. Commits to this repository will be used as a metric (one of several) of each team member’s relative contribution to each project.\n\n\nActivities & Assessment\nYou will be assessed based on five components: application exercises, labs, exams, project, and teamwork.\n\nLabs\nIn labs, you will apply what you’ve learned in the videos and during lectures to complete data analysis tasks. You may discuss lab assignments with other students; however, the lab should be completed and submitted individually. Lab assignments must be typed up using Quarto, all work must be pushed to your GitHub repository for the lab, and the lab’s PDF output must be submitted on Gradescope by the deadline.\nLabs are due at 8:30 am ET on the indicated due date (generally the Monday after the lab).\nThe lowest lab grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.\n\n\nExams\nThis course will have two exams: a midterm and a final. The midterm will include an in-class component (with a cheat sheet) and an open-note take-home component, while the final will include only an in-class component (with a cheat sheet).\nYou can demonstrate what you’ve learned in the course thus far through these exams. The exams will focus on both conceptual understanding of the content and application through analysis and computational tasks. The exam’s content will be related to the content in videos and reading assignments, lectures, application exercises, and labs.\nMore details about the exams will be given during the semester.\n\n\nProject\nThe project aims to apply what you’ve learned throughout the semester to analyze an interesting data-driven research question. The project will be completed in teams, and each team will present their work in the last lab session of the semester. The write-up will be due on the same day.\nYou cannot pass this course if you have not completed the project.\nMore information about the project will be provided during the semester.\n\n\nApplication exercises\nParts of some lectures will be dedicated to working on Application Exercises (AEs). These exercises allow you to apply the statistical concepts and code introduced in the preparation materials. These AEs are due by 2 pm ET on the day of the lecture they are covered. To submit the AEs, you only need to push your work to your GitHub repo.\nBecause these AEs are for practice, they will be graded based on attempt, i.e., a good-faith effort has been made in attempting all parts.\nSuccessful on-time completion of at least 70% of AEs will result in full credit for AEs in the final course grade.",

    "text": "Course policies\n\nDuke Community Standard\nAs a student in this course, you have agreed to uphold the Duke Community Standard and the practices specific to this course.\n\n\n\n\nAcademic honesty\nTL;DR: Don’t cheat!\nPlease abide by the following as you work on assignments in this course:\n\nCollaboration: Only work that is clearly assigned as teamwork should be completed collaboratively.\n\nYou may discuss lab assignments with other students; however, you may not directly share (or copy) code or write-up with other students. For team assignments, you may collaborate freely within your team. You may discuss the assignment with other teams; however, you may not directly share (or copy) code or write-up with another team. Unauthorized sharing (or copying) of the code or write-up will be considered a violation for all students involved.\nYou may not discuss or otherwise work with others on the exams. Unauthorized collaboration or using unauthorized materials will be considered a violation for all students involved. More details will be given closer to the exam date.\nCollaboration within teams is not only allowed but expected for the project. Communication between teams at a high level is also allowed; however, you may not share code or project components across teams.\nOn individual assignments, you may not directly share work (including code) with another student in this class; on team assignments, you may not directly share work (including code) with another team.\n\nOnline resources: I am well aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web to solve any number of problems. Unless I explicitly tell you not to use something, the course’s policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g., StackOverflow), but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration). Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.\nUse of generative artificial intelligence (AI): You should treat generative AI, such as ChatGPT, like other online resources. Two guiding principles govern how to use AI in this course:\n\nCognitive dimension: Working with AI should not reduce your thinking ability. We will practice using AI to facilitate—rather than hinder—learning.\nEthical dimension: Students using AI should be transparent about their use and ensure it aligns with academic integrity.\n\n\n AI tools for code: You may use the technology for coding examples on assignments; if you do so, you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. You may use these guidelines to cite AI-generated content. The bare minimum citation must include the AI tool you’re using (e.g., ChatGPT) and your prompt. The prompt you use cannot be copied and pasted directly from the assignment; you must create a prompt yourself.\n AI tools for narrative: Unless instructed otherwise, you may not use generative AI to generate a narrative that you then copy-paste verbatim into an assignment or edit and then insert into your assignment.\n AI tools for learning: You’re welcomed to ask AI tools questions that might help your learning and understanding in this course.\n\nIn general, you may use generative AI as a resource as you complete assignments but not to answer the exercises for you. You are ultimately responsible for the work you turn in; it should reflect your understanding of the course content. Identifying AI-generated content is fairly straightforward. Any code identified as AI-generated but not cited as such and any narrative identified as AI-generated will be considered plagiarism and treated as such.\n\nIf you are unsure if using a particular resource complies with the academic honesty policy, please ask a teaching team member.\nRegardless of course delivery format, it is the responsibility of all students to understand and follow all Duke policies, including academic integrity (e.g., completing one’s own work, following proper citation of sources, adhering to guidance around group work projects, and more). Ignoring these requirements is a violation of the Duke Community Standard. Any questions and/or concerns regarding academic integrity can be directed to the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards at conduct@duke.edu.\nAny violations in academic honesty standards as outlined in the Duke Community Standard and those specific to this course will\n\nautomatically results in a 0 for the relevant portion or the entire assignment,\ncan further impact your overall course grade, and\nwill be reported to the Office of Student Conduct & Community Standards for further action.\n\n\n\nLate work & extensions\nThe due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback in a timely manner. We understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline. Note that the lowest lab assignment will be dropped to accommodate such circumstances.\n\nLabs may be submitted up to 3 days late. A 5% deduction will be applied for each 24-hour period during which the assignment is late.\nNo late work is accepted for application exercises since these are designed to help you prepare for other assessments in the course.\nNo late work is accepted for exams.\nNo late work is accepted for projects.\n\n\n\nWaiver for extenuating circumstances\nIf circumstances prevent you from completing a lab by the stated due date, you may email the course coordinator, Dr. Mary Knox, before the deadline to waive the late penalty. In your email, you only need to request the waiver; you do not need to provide an explanation. This waiver may only be used once a semester, so only use it for a truly extenuating circumstance.\nIf circumstances have a longer-term impact on your academic performance, please let your academic dean know. They can be a resource. Please let me know if you need help contacting your academic dean.\n\n\nRegrade requests\nRegrade requests must be submitted on Gradescope within a week after an assignment is returned. Regrade requests will be considered if there was an error in the grade calculation or if you feel a correct answer was mistakenly marked as incorrect. Requests to dispute the number of points deducted for an incorrect response will not be considered. Note that by submitting a regrade request, the entire assignment may be regraded, which could potentially result in losing points.\nNo grades will be changed after the final exam has been administered.\n\n\nAttendance policy\nEvery student is expected to attend and participate in lecture and labs. There may be times, however, when you cannot attend class. Lecture recordings are available upon request for students who have an excused absence. See the Lecture recording request policy for more detail. If you miss a lecture, make sure to review the material and complete the application exercise, if applicable, before the next lecture. Labs dedicated to completing the lab assignment and collaborating with your lab team. If you miss a lab session, make sure to communicate with your lab TA and teammates about how you can make up your contribution. If you know you’re going to miss a lab session and you’re feeling well enough to do so, notify your lab TA and teammates ahead of time.\nMore details on Trinity attendance policies are available here.\n\n\nLecture recording request\nLectures will be recorded on Panopto and will be made available to students with an excused absence upon request. Videos shared with such students will be available for a week after the lecture date. To request a particular lecture’s video, please fill out the form at the link below. Please submit the form within 24 hours of missing lecture to ensure you have sufficient time to watch the recording. Please also make sure that any official documentation, such as STINFs, Dean’s excuses, NOVAPs, and quarantine/removal from class notices from student health are also uploaded to the form.\n🔗 https://forms.office.com/r/kJ6cWGE1Mp\nAbout one week before each exam, the class recordings will be available to all students. These recordings will be available until the start of the exam.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here for syllabus bounty!\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you’ve read this far in the syllabus, post a picture of your pet if you have one or your favorite meme on ed in this thread!

You are encouraged to attend office hours during the times posted on the home page to ask questions about the course content and assignments. Many questions are most effectively answered in person, so office hours are a valuable resource. I encourage each and every one of you to take advantage of this resource! Make a pledge to stop by during office hours at least once during the first three weeks of class. If you have no questions, stop by and say hi and introduce yourself. You can find a list of everyone’s office hours here.\nMy office hours will start in Week 1, TA office hours will start in Week 2.\n\n\nEd Discussion\nHave a question that can’t wait for office hours? Prefer to write out your question in detail rather than asking in person? The course discussion forum, Ed Discussion, is the best venue for these! There is a chance another student has already asked a similar question, so please check the other posts on before asking a new question. If you know the answer to a question that is posted, I encourage you to respond!\nYou can access this tool on the course website toolbar – just click on the lifesaver icon.\n\n\nPeer tutoring\nMINT Peer Tutoring (Meaningful Interactive Tutoring) are small groups of 2-5 students in the same course who meet weekly with a Peer Tutor. This semester, Peer Tutor who will be leading MINT Peer Tutoring for STA 199 is Stanley Borden (stanley.borden@duke.edu).\nThe peer tutoring groups are a resource focused on allowing students to receive additional support for questions they have on the course content while still being part of a community of fellow learners. Peer tutors communicate with students in advance of the meetings so that they can be responsive to student needs during the group meetings. Some groups meet in person and some meet virtually.\n\nIn person, Wednesday 7:00 pm\nVirtual, Wednesday 8:05 pm\n\nFor more details and to see what other courses we offer services for, please visit their website: https://arc.duke.edu/peer-education\nSignups for MINT Peer Tutoring open the morning of Thursday, September 5th and groups start meeting on Monday, September 9th.\nNote that peer tutors are not directly affiliated with the course, however they tend to be students who have taken the course in the past.",

    "text": "TL;DR: Ask a question you’re curious about and answer it with a dataset of your choice. This is your project in a nutshell.\nMay be too long, but please do read\nThe project for this course will consist of analysis on a dataset of your own choosing. The dataset may already exist, or you may collect your own data using a survey or by conducting an experiment. You can choose the data based on your teams’ interests or based on work in other courses or research projects. The goal of this project is for you to demonstrate proficiency in the techniques we have covered in this course (and beyond, if you like) and apply them to a novel dataset in a meaningful way.\nThe goal is not to do an exhaustive data analysis i.e., do not calculate every statistic and procedure you have learned for every variable, but rather let me know that you are proficient at asking meaningful questions and answering them with results of data analysis, that you are proficient in using R, and that you are proficient at interpreting and presenting the results. Focus on methods that help you begin to answer your research questions. You do not have to apply every statistical procedure we learned. Also, critique your own methods and provide suggestions for improving your analysis. Issues pertaining to the reliability and validity of your data, and appropriateness of the statistical analysis should be discussed here.\nThe project is very open ended. You should create some kind of compelling visualization(s) of this data in R. There is no limit on what tools or packages you may use but sticking to packages we learned in the course is required. You do not need to visualize all of the data at once. A single high-quality visualization will receive a much higher grade than a large number of poor-quality visualizations. Also pay attention to your presentation. Neatness, coherency, and clarity will count. All analyses must be done in RStudio, using R, and all components of the project must be reproducible (with the exception of the slide deck).\nYou will work on the project with your lab teams.\nThe four milestones for the final project are\n\nMilestone 1 - Working collaboratively\nMilestone 2 - Proposals, with three dataset ideas\nMilestone 3 - Improvement and progress\nMilestone 4 - Peer review, on another team’s project\nMilestone 5 - Presentation with slides and a reproducible project write-up of your analysis, with a draft along the way.\n\nYou will not be submitting anything on Gradescope for the project. Submission of these deliverables will happen on GitHub and feedback will be provided as GitHub issues that you need to engage with and close. The collection of the documents in your GitHub repo will create a webpage for your project. To create the webpage go to the Build tab in RStudio, and click on Render Website.",

Filling out the survey is a prerequisite for getting credit on the team member evaluation. If you are suggesting that an individual did less than half the expected contribution given your team size (e.g., for a team of four students, if a student contributed less than 12.5% of the total effort), please provide some explanation. If any individual gets an average peer score indicating that this was the case, their grade will be assessed accordingly and penalties may apply beyond the teamwork component of the grade.\nIf you have concerns with the teamwork and/or contribution from any team members, please email me by the project presentation deadline. You only need to email me if you have concerns. Otherwise, I will assume everyone on the team equally contributed and will receive full credit for the teamwork portion of the grade.",

Are the limitations carefully considered? Does it appear that time and effort went into the planning and implementation of the project?\n\nA general breakdown of scoring is as follows:\n\n90%-100%: Outstanding effort. Student understands how to apply all statistical concepts, can put the results into a cogent argument, can identify weaknesses in the argument, and can clearly communicate the results to others.\n80%-89%: Good effort. Student understands most of the concepts, puts together an adequate argument, identifies some weaknesses of their argument, and communicates most results clearly to others.\n70%-79%: Passing effort. Student has misunderstanding of concepts in several areas, has some trouble putting results together in a cogent argument, and communication of results is sometimes unclear.\n60%-69%: Struggling effort. Student is making some effort, but has misunderstanding of many concepts and is unable to put together a cogent argument. Communication of results is unclear.\nBelow 60%: Student is not making a sufficient effort.",
